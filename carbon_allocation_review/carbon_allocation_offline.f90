! Carbon allocation
!==========================================================================
! This file is intentionally verbose. The comments are part of the model
! documentation and are meant to help a future reader understand why each
! equation appears in the code. 
!
! Purpose
! -------
! This module implements a self-contained woody-plant carbon allocation
! kernel based on the LPJ-style allometric allocation logic. BUT important:
! Not using "abnormal allocation" as LPJ-style. If there is no feasible solution 
! to the normal allometric problem, the carbon goes to storage instead of being 
! forced into a non-allometric solution. This is a more
! conservative approach that avoids unrealistic jumps in plant structure
!
! Scope of this first version
! ---------------------------
! This kernel solves allocation for ONE average woody individual over ONE
! allocation period. The allocation period can be annual, monthly, seasonal,
! or any other interval. The equations do not know the calendar frequency.
! The caller only needs to provide the carbon available over that period (here
! we are using daily because CAETE works on a daily basis).
!
! Key idea for the gradual storage-based allocation scheme
! -------------------------------------------------------
! Daily carbon input is first added to a labile storage pool. Structural
! growth is then paid from storage only when there is positive allocation
! demand and enough available carbon. If negative NPP exhausts storage, the
! remaining deficit is treated as a starvation pressure on living tissues:
! one third is assigned to leaves, one third to fine roots, and one third to
! sapwood. Leaf and fine-root losses remove carbon from the plant, whereas
! sapwood loss is converted into heartwood.
!
! In contrast to the legacy rigid allocation scheme (strictly based in LPJ), this routine does not
! force the plant to satisfy allometric constraints exactly at each daily
! timestep. Instead, the leaf-root relationship and the pipe-model relationship
! are used to compute structural demand. This demand gradually moves the plant
! toward allometric consistency over the timescale defined by
! allometric_adjustment_days.
!
! The structural increment is:
!
!     structural_growth = dL + dR + dS
!
! where:
!
!     dL = increment to leaf carbon mass
!     dR = increment to fine-root carbon mass
!     dS = increment to sapwood carbon mass
!
! If there is no structural demand, or if daily allocation is limited by the
! maximum allocation fraction, carbon remains in storage instead of being
! forced into an abnormal allocation pathway.
!
! Height is updated from total stem carbon rather than by forcing the
! pipe-model residual to zero at each daily timestep. The pipe model therefore
! acts as a gradual demand signal, not as an instantaneous constraint.

      real(real64) :: dt_years = 1.0_real64 / 365.0_real64

      ! Time scale used to relax allometric imbalances.
      ! A value of 365 means that a full allometric deficit is not corrected
      ! instantly; instead, roughly 1/365 of the deficit becomes demand per day.
      real(real64) :: allometric_adjustment_days = 365.0_real64

      ! Maximum relative structural growth allowed in one time step.
      !
      ! This parameter is a daily growth-rate cap. It prevents the plant from
      ! converting a very large amount of storage carbon into new structural biomass
      ! in a single time step, even when storage and allometric demand are both high.
      !
      ! This is important because the original LPJ allocation logic was annual,
      ! whereas this routine is applied at a daily time step. Without this cap, large
      ! allometric deficits or large storage pools could produce unrealistic daily
      ! jumps in leaf, fine-root, or sapwood biomass.
      !
      ! For example, max_allocation_fraction = 0.005 means that daily structural
      ! growth cannot exceed 0.5% of current living structural carbon:
      !
      !     max_daily_allocation = 0.005 * (leaf + root + sapwood)
      !
      ! This parameter should be interpreted as a maximum tissue-construction
      ! capacity, not as a carbon-availability term.

      ! In this allocation scheme, the plant is not forced to satisfy allometric

      ! relationship and the pipe-model relationship are used to define
      ! structural growth demands that gradually move the plant toward
      ! allometric consistency.
      !
      ! Therefore, leaf_root_residual and pipe_model_residual are not expected
      ! to be exactly zero after every allocation step. They should be interpreted
      ! as diagnostic measures of the current allometric imbalance. Under
      ! adequate carbon supply and reasonable parameter values, these residuals
      ! should generally move toward smaller absolute values over time.

      !         carbon_to_allocate - (delta_leaf + delta_root + delta_sapwood)
      !

      ! structural growth must be distributed among leaf, fine-root, and sapwood
      ! increments.
      !
      ! leaf_root_residual measures the mismatch between final leaf and fine-root
      ! pools:
      !
      !     leaf_root_residual =
      !         leaf_mass_new - leaf_to_root_ratio * root_mass_new
      !
      ! A positive value indicates relatively more leaf carbon than expected from
      ! the target leaf-root relationship. A negative value indicates relatively
      ! more fine-root carbon.
      !
      ! pipe_model_residual measures the mismatch between final leaf area and
      ! sapwood conductive area:
      !
      !     pipe_model_residual =
      !         leaf_area_new - latosa * sapwood_area_new
      !
      ! A negative value indicates that leaf area is low relative to sapwood area.
      ! A positive value indicates that leaf area is high relative to sapwood area.
      !
